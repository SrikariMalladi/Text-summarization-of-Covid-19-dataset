# Text-summarization-of-Covid-19-dataset
This is a project on summarizing long abstracts related to COVID - 19 in the language of English. In this project, we have implemented a hybrid text summarizer which is a combination of both extractive and abstractive text summarizers. In the initial phases, we have pre-processed the entire dataset and passed it into an extractive text summarizer and then into an abstractive summarizer which will give us a summarized text of 4-5 sentences.
